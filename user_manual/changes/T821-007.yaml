title: Imprecise fallback on navigation properties
description: |
    From now on, navigation properties (such as ``p_previous_part``,
    ``p_body_part`` & co.) can be invoked in imprecise fallback mode, meaning
    that an ad-hoc routine will try to carry out the execution if the normal
    "precise" path fails. This breaks the Python API because adding a boolean
    parameter ``imprecise_fallback`` on those properties means that they must
    now be called with parentheses all the time.
