short_title: BodyStub.p_syntactic_fully_qualified_name property

description: |
    The new ``BodyStub.p_syntactic_fully_qualified_name`` property allows one
    to query the name of a body stub purely based on the syntax. Unlike
    ``BasicDecl.p_fully_qualified_name``, this does not populate lexical
    environments, and so is more efficient for this restricted use case.
