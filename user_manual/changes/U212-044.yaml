type: bugfix
title: Derived type with discriminant constraints
description: |
    This changes fixes a name resolution failure that would occur on aggregate
    of a derived type constraining the discriminants of its parent type, as in
    the following example:

    .. code:: ada

        type T (X : Boolean) is record
            case X is
                when True =>
                    F : Integer;
                when others =>
                    null;
            end case;
        end record;
        type U is new T (True);

        V : U := (X => True, F => 42);  -- Libadalang would crash here

    Libadalang now correctly handles such patterns.
