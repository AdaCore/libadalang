title: Fix access-to-subprogram Pre/Post aspects support
description: |
  This patch fixes incorrect support of access-to-subprogram Pre/Post aspects
  handling. Aspects were wrongly parsed along with the access-to-subprogram
  while they should be parsed along with the corresponding declaration. Name
  resolution has been fixed accordingly too: in Ada 2022, Pre/Post accesses are
  allowed on access-to-subprogram, therefore it is now part of the resolution.
