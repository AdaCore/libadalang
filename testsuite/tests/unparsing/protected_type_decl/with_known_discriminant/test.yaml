    This test checks the formatting of a protected type declaration
    with known discriminant and public and private part.
    It is expected the declaration breaks before the discriminant
    specification, after `is` keyword and be formatted by indenting
    the discriminant specificatin, public and private part content and
    keeping the `protected`, `is`, `private` and `end` keywords aligned.
