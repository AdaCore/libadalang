    This test checks the formatting of an enumeration type
    declaration. It is expected that the declaration line
    breaks after the is keyword and the enumeration type
    definition be indented by a line continuation indentation
    (i.e., 2 spaces). The enumeration type definition should
    break, each new line will contain an element of the list
    and the enumeration literals should be aligned on the
    position of the first element of the list.
