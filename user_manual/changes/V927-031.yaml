title: Fix name resolution of ref to generic inside body
description: |
  When referencing a generic inside its own body, in the context of an
  instantiation, ``P_Referenced_Decl`` wouldn't return a properly bound node
  (with the correct generic context corresponding to the instantiation). This
  is now fixed.

  .. code-block:: ada

      procedure Test_It is
         generic procedure P2_G;

         procedure P2_G is
         begin
            P2_G; -- <- This reference would return a node with no generic context
         end;

         procedure P2 is new P2_G;
      begin
         null;
      end Test_It;
