    This test checks the formatting of a with clause having
    a list of package names exceeding the maximal line length.
    The packages are designated by dotted and simple names with
    different casing. It is expected to break after the comma, 
    align on the first element of the package list and keep the
    casing unchanged. The long dotted name will be formatted as
    expected: a line break is inserted before . and the alignment 
    is based on the initial position of the first field and a line
    continuation indentation (i.e., 2 spaces) is added before each
    . on each new line.
