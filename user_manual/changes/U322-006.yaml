title: Fix P_Fully_Qualified_Name on GenericSubpInternal
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where calling the ``P_Fully_Qualified_Name``
    property on a ``GenericSubpInternal`` node would yield a non-sensical
    result. It will now yield the fully qualified name of the underlying
    generic declaration.
