    This test checks the formatting of a derived type declaration with
    non empty interface list and record extension.
    It is expected the declaration breaks after `is` and `before `record`;
    the interface list be splitted and aligned on the first element after
    `new`keyword and the record extension part aligned with the `new` keyword
    as well.
