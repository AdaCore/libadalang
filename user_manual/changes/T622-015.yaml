title: Rename ``Children_With_Trivia`` and make it return ghost nodes
short_title: Rename Children_With_Trivia and fix for ghost nodes

description: |
    For extra clarity, the ``Children_With_Trivia`` function in
    ``Libadalang.Analysis`` has been renamed ``Children_And_Trivia``. Moreover,
    its returned array now includes children ghost nodes, so that the result of
    the ``Children`` function is always a subset of the result of the
    ``Children_And_Trivia`` result.
