type: bugfix
title: Name resolution of ``limited with`` clauses
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where calling ``P_Referenced_Decl`` on any part
    of a limited with clause importing a child unit of the current unit would
    yield ``None``. The declaration inside the designated CompilationUnit is
    now correctly returned.
