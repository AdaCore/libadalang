title: Resolve references to parent units in end names
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where references to parent units in the end name
    of a library-level child subprogram would not be resolved. For example, in:

    .. code:: ada

        procedure Pkg.Foo is
        begin
            null;
        end Pkg.Foo;

    Calling ``P_Referenced_Decl`` on the identifier ``Pkg`` in ``end Pkg.Foo;``
    used to return None, whereas it will now correctly return the declaration
    of the package ``Pkg``.
