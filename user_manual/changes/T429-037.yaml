title: Nameres failure on generic instantiations
description: |
    Some generic instantiations could previously cause name resolution to
    crash, in particular when another generic declaration having the same
    name as one intended to be instantiated would be available to the
    resolution mechanism. The fix was to specifically filter out those
    declarations by only keeping those that are visible in the Ada sense.
