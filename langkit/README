Langkit
=======

Dependencies
------------

To use Langkit:

- Quex version 0.64.8 - http://sourceforge.net/projects/quex/files/HISTORY/0.64
  Follow the installation guide in the quex README
- The mako template system for Python (see REQUIREMENTS.dev)
- Clang-format

Install
-------

There is no proper distribution for the langkit Python package, so just add the
top-level langkit directory to your PYTHONPATH in order to use it.  Note that
this directory is self-contained, so you can copy it somewhere else.

Testing
-------

There is currently no testsuite dedicated to Langkit. Yeah, it's bad! But we
plan to add one at some point.

Documentation
-------------

A Sphinx documentation is planned and should land soon!

Bootstrapping a new language engine
-----------------------------------

Nothing is more simple than getting an initial project skeleton to work on a
new language engine. Imagine you want to create an engine for the Foo language,
run from the top-level directory:

$ python langkit/create-project.py Foo

And then have a look at the created "foo" directory: you have minimal
lexers and parsers and a "manage.py" script you can use to build this new
engine:

$ python foo/manage.py make

Here you are!

Developer tools
---------------

Langkit uses mako templates generating Ada, C and Python code. This can be hard
to read. To ease development, vim syntax files are available under the utils
directory (see makoada.vim, makocpp.vim). Put them in your .vim/syntax
directory to get automatic highlighting of the template files.
