title: Add ``P_Shapes`` property
description: |
    This property, when called on the ComponentList of a record definition,
    will return the list of all possible shapes that a record value of this
    type can take. Consider the following record definition:

    .. code:: ada

       type R (A : Integer; B : Integer) is record
          X : Integer;
          case A is
             when 1 .. 10 =>
                Y_1 : Integer;
                case B is
                   when 1 .. 10 =>
                      Z_1 : Integer;
                   when others => null;
                end case;
             when 11 .. 20 =>
                Y_2 : Integer;
                case B is
                   when 1 .. 10 =>
                      Z_2 : Integer;
                   when others => null;
                end case;
             when others => null;
          end case;
       end record;

    For this instance, this property will return the following results:

    .. code::

       [
           [X, Y_1, Z_1],
           [X, Y_1],
           [X, Y_2, Z_2],
           [X, Y_2],
           [X]
       ]
