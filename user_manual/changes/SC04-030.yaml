title: Resolution of calls to primitives

description: |
    So far for calls of the form `X.Foo`, libadalang would always resolve
    `Foo` to the base-most declaration of the subprogram `Foo`. This is
    not accurate in case the type of `X` is statically known to be a child
    type which provides an override of `Foo`. After this change, `Foo` in `X.Foo`
    now correctly resolves to the most precise override available of `Foo` for
    `X`.
