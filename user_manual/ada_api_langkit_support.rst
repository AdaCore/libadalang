Langkit support
===============

These units are part of Libadalang's public API indirectly. Libadalang is a
library generated via the `Langkit <https://github.com/AdaCore/langkit/>`_
framework, and as such, it depends on Langkit's runtime, which is Langkit
support. Some parts of Langkit support are thus part of the public API of
Libadalang.
