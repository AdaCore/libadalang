title: Visibility of child instantiations on their parent
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where child package or subprogram instantiations
    would not have correct visibility on their parent if their parent was a
    package instantiation itself. Consider the following package declarations:

    .. code::

        -- pkg_g.ads
        generic package Pkg_G is end Pkg_G;

        -- pkg_g-child_g.ads
        generic package Pkg_G.Child_G is end Pkg_G.Child_G;

        -- my_pkg.ads
        package My_Pkg is new Pkg_G;

        -- my_pkg-my_child.ads
        package My_Pkg.My_Child is new Child_G;

    Libadalang previously failed to resolve the last instantiation because
    it did not have visibility on ``Child_G``. (Note however that it correctly
    resolved it if ``Child_G`` was qualified with ``My_Pkg.Child_G``).
