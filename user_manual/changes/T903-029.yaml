title: Crash on renaming of Ada.Wide_*Text_IO package
description: |
    This fixes an issue where Libadalang would fail to do any kind of name
    analysis on a source that would "use" a package renaming an instantiation
    of the ``Ada.Wide_Text_IO`` or ``Ada.Wide_Wide_Text_IO`` packages, such as
    ``Ada.Integer_Wide_Text_IO``.
