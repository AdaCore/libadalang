title: Get rid of ``Name.p_xref``

description: |
    Its behavior is considered non intuitive, and is not properly
    documented, nor tested.

    The workaround is to replace calls to ``p_xref`` by the equivalent set of
    navigation property calls, such as ``p_previous_part``/``p_next_part`` for
    declarations and bodies.
