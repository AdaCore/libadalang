title: Fix output of ``P_Base/Root_Subp_Declarations``
description: |
    Until now, those properties could return several subprogram declarations
    denoting the same entity (for example its specification and its body),
    and sometimes even twice the *same* subprogram specification or body.
    This change homogenizes the output of those property to prevent
    duplicate entries. As such, the canonical part of each subprogram
    is returned, after having removed duplicates.
