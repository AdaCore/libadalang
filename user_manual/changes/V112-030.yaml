description: |
    This change adds support for Ada 2022 user-defined literals. In particular,
    Libadalang name resolution used to fail on expressions expecting a type
    defining an ``Integer_Literal``, ``Real_Literal`` or ``String_Literal``
    aspect but for which an integer literal, real literal or string literal
    was given, respectively.
