title: Fix ``P_Get_Pragma`` on generic instantiations
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where the ``P_Get_Pragma`` property and all
    properties using it (``P_Has_Aspect``, etc.) would not behave properly on
    generic instantiation nodes: a pragma associated to such node would never
    be recognized by these properties.
