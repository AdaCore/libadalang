description: |
   It may be interesting for file readers to return both decoded contents and
   also diagonstics, for example when doing error recovery while transcoding
   the source buffer.

   The ``Read`` primitives did not allow this previously: ``Contents`` was
   considered uninitialized when ``Diagnostics`` was not empty. ``Read``
   callers can now expect ``Contents`` to be initialized instead to support
   this case.
