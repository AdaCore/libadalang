title: Fix subprogram navigation in presence of use clauses
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where a use clause could impact the navigation
    (in particular, when finding the previous part) of a subprogram when the
    used package would contain a matching subprogram declaration, as that
    declaration could be returned when there is really no previous part.
