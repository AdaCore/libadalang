    This test checks the formatting of a record type declaration that contains
    a comment between the `is` and the `record` keyword. This comment is long
    enough so that its formatting will necessarily exceed the maximum width.

    The unparsing configuration used to yield an extra line break after the
    comment at each reformatting step (unstable formatting).

driver: unparser
rule: type_decl
