title: Consolidate meaning of RefResultKind values
description: |
    Until now, the meaning of the different RefResultKind values that could
    be returned by e.g a ``P_Failsafe_Referenced_Decl`` query was a bit
    chaotic. For example, ``Precise`` could be returned together with a null
    node as value. ``Error`` would be sometimes returned for queries made on
    names that were not referenced instead of ``NoRef``. This change sanitizes
    the output so that:

    - ``NoRef`` is always returned for queries made on names that are not
      references (e.g. defining names, attribute names) or references to
      entities that have no declaration (e.g. built-in operators)
    - ``Error`` is reserved to cases where Libadalang fails to resolve the
      name, either because of an internal problem or because of invalid
      input.
    - ``Precise`` is never returned with a null value.
