title: Behavior of ``Is_Dispatching_Call`` on ``Op`` nodes
description: |
    This change fixes the behavior of the ``P_Is_Dispatching_Call`` property
    on nodes of kind ``Op`` (appearing inside an ``UnOp`` or ``BinOp`` node).
    It now ensures that the result of this property is the same as if it was
    called on the underlying ``UnOp`` or ``BinOp`` node.
