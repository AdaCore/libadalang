title: Support for GNATprep-compatible preprocessing
description: |
  Libadalang now embeds an integrated preprocessor. This makes it possible to
  transparently use Libadalang services (parsing, navigation, name resolution,
  etc.) on a project that contains preprocessing directives/symbols.

  Ada API users can enable the integrated preprocessor thanks to the
  ``Libadalang.Preprocessing`` package, and Python API users can enable it
  using the ``libadalang.FileReader.create_preprocessor_from_file`` function.

  Please refer to the User Manual for more information.
