title: Fix ``GenericSubpInst.subp_spec_or_null``
description: |
    The ``subp_spec_or_null`` property would not work correctly on generic
    subprogram instantiations, and hence some other calls relying on that would
    also fail, such as `is_dispatching_call` on a call to a generic subprogram
    instantiation. This is now fixed.
