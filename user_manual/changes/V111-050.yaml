title: Add a ``P_Enclosing_Compilation_Unit`` property
description: |
    When invoked a node, returns the compilation unit in which the node
    belongs. This is different from ``Unit`` which returns the corresponding
    *Analysis* unit, because there may be several compilation units defined
    in the same analysis unit.
