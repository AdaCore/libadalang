title: Inconsistent results of navigation properties
description: |
    This fixes a bug where navigation properties such as ``P_Previous_Part``,
    ``P_Canonical_Part`` and so on could yield different results across
    calls on a same ``Body`` node retrieved in different ways. This should not
    happen because the previous part of a node is predetermined and must not
    depend on the path taken to reach said node.
