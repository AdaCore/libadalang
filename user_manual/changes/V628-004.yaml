description: |
    This change fixes a name resolution bug where index constraints on access
    to array types wouldn't be resolved correctly.

    .. code-block:: ada
       
       type Int_Array is array (Integer range <>) of Integer;
       type Array_Access is access Int_Array;

       X : Array_Access (1 .. 10);
       --               ^ Wouldn't be resolved correctly
