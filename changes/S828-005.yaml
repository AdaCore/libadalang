title: Replace ``Name.p_referenced_id`` by ``Name.p_referenced_defining_name``
short_title: Get rid of Name.p_referenced_id

description: |
    ``referenced_defining_name`` doesn't take any argument, and uses
    the result of ``referenced_decl`` on ``self``.

    Existing calls to ``self.referenced_id(self.referenced_decl)`` can just be
    replaced by ``self.referenced_defining_name``.

    Calls to ``self.referenced_id(other_decl)`` have no simple remplacement,
    but are considered non-important.
