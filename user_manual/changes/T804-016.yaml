title: Fix ``P_Is_Defining`` on dotted defining names
description: |
    Previously, ``P_Is_Defining`` would always return True for the suffix
    of any dotted name appearing inside a defining name. For example, for
    the declaration of an unit ``A.B.C``, ``P_Is_Defining`` would incorrectly
    return True on ``B``. Now, only the outermost dotted name and its suffix
    will be considered defining (here, ``A.B.C`` and ``C``).
