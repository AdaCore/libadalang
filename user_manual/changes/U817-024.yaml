title: Fix visibility issue of overriden subprogram
description: |
    This change fixes a visibility issue arising when resolving a reference
    to a subprogram overriden in the public part of a package if the type
    has a refined declaration in its private part, in which case the inherited
    subprogram would incorrectly take precedence over the overriden one
    (see testcase precise_override_2).
