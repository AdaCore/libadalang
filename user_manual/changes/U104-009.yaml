title: Fix ``P_Base_Subp_Declarations`` on incomplete types
description: |
    This change fixes the behavior of the ``P_Base_Subp_Declarations``
    property when called on a primitive subprogram of an incomplete type
    which full view is a tagged type with a possible base type. Before this
    patch, it was not possible to find base declarations of such subprograms
    because Libadalang would always work from the view of the subprogram, thus
    missing information about the base type. This change fixes that issue.
