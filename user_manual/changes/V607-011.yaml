title: Fix ``TypeDecl`` name resolution
description: |
  This change fixes a bug where a ``TypeDecl`` that has a user-defined indexing
  aspect could lead to an infinite recursion if one of the indexing functions
  denoted by the aspect has the same return type as the one for which the aspect
  is defined. As for example in:

  .. code-block:: ada

    type T (Kind : K) is tagged private
    with Constant_Indexing => Fn;

    function Fn (P1 : T; P2 : Integer) return T;
