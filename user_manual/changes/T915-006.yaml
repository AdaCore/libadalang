title: Nameres of ``CallExpr`` when name is an attribute
description: |
    Until now, libadalang would fail to resolve most ``CallExpr`` expressions
    when the name of such ``CallExpr`` would be an ``AttributeRef``, typically
    meaning that the ``CallExpr`` represents a subscript operation over the
    array returned by the ``AttributeRef`` (as in ``X'Image (2 .. 3)``). This
    is now correctly handled.
