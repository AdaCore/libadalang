title: Fix properties related to parent/derived_types
description: |
  This change fixes ``BaseTypeDecl.is_derived_type`` so that it always returns
  ``False`` when the first argument is a classwide type and the second is not.

  It also fixes ``ClasswideTypeDecl.base_type/base_types`` properties, so that
  they return ``null``/the empty set, as it should be for class-wide types.
