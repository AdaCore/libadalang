title: Consistent behavior of ``P_Next_Part_For_Decl``
description: |
    This change improves the consistency of ``P_Next_Part_For_Decl``.
    In particular, the default result when no next part is found is None,
    whereas previously it could either return None, return itself or raise
    an exception.
