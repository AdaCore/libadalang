title: Fix ``Base_Subp_Declarations`` on incomplete types
description: |
    This changes fixes a bug where calling the ``Base_Subp_Declarations``
    property on a subprogram declared in a package body and defining a
    primitive over an incomplete type which completion is declared in
    that same package body would always return an empty list.
