title: Fix visibility rules inside component decls
description: |
    This change fixes an issue caused by the previous visibility rules inside
    component decls being too permissive. For example in the snippet below:

    .. code:: ada

        type Rec is record
            Set : access Set.T;
        end record;

    Libadalang used to be confused when resolving the reference to ``Set``
    because of the enclosing component having the same name, causing infinite
    recursions leading to stack overflows. This change fixes that issue by
    discarding the enclosing component when looking up names from one of its
    child nodes.
