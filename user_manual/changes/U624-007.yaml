title: Configuration pragrmas handling
description: |
  ``CompilationUnit`` nodes have new properties: ``P_All_Config_Pragmas`` and
  ``P_Config_Pragmas``. They both allow one to query the list of configuration
  pragmas that apply to a given compilation unit. In order to use them, one
  needs to associate configuration pragmas files to analysis units thanks to
  the subprograms defined in the ``Libadalang.Config_Pragmas`` package first.
