title: Resolution of calls to entries of SingleTaskTypeDecl

description: |
    So far name resolution was failing on calls to an entry defined in a Task
    declaration (not a task type declaration). This was because
    SingleTaskTypeDecl would not reimplement the defining_env primitive which
    we use to retrieve names defined by this type. This change provides the
    implementation of this primitive for a SingleTaskTypeDecl.
