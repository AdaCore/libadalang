title: Fix P_Has_Aspect property for Pre/Post aspects
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where evaluating this property on a subprogram
    with a precondition or a postcondition using ``Pre`` or ``Post`` as
    argument would crash due to Libadalang trying to evaluate the
    expression in the contract.
