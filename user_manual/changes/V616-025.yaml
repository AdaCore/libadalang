title: Add ``SyntheticCharEnumLit`` missing support
description: |
  Freshly introduced ``SyntheticCharEnumLit`` node, used to synthesize character
  literals, was missing some support. This change fixes the
  ``p_unique_identifying_name`` property, which was failing when called on a
  ``SyntheticDefiningName`` (representing the synthetic character literal).
