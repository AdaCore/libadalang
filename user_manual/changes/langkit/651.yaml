title: Return value of ``Children_And_Trivia`` type changes
description: |
  The ``Children_And_Trivia`` function has been modified and does not return an
  Ada array anymore. Instead the return type ``Children_Array`` is a custom type
  with the ``Iterable`` aspect, which may break user code. For instance:

    * ``for C in N.Children_And_Trivia'Range`` should become ``for C in
      N.Children_And_Trivia``

    * ``X (I)`` should become ``Element (X, I)`` when ``X`` is the result of
      ``Children_And_Trivia``

  Note that the ``for C of ..`` iteration style is not affected by this API
  break.
