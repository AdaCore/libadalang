title: Fix nameres of array concats without expected type
description: |
  This change fixes a bug where Libadalang could fail to resolve an array
  concatenation expression in a context where no type is expected, such as the
  expression inside a type conversion: ``X: String := String (A & 'b' & C);``.
  The failure used to occur in particular when one of the operands of the
  concatenation was a subtype of the other.
