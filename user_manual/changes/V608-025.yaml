title: Add a GPR2 based unit provider
description: |
    In order to prepare for the upcoming deprecation of ``GNATCOLL.Projects``
    and replacement by the new GPR2 library, this change duplicates Libadalang
    APIs to create unit providers based on projects to work with projects
    loaded using GPR2.

    Note however that just like GPR2, this new API should be considered as still
    work in progress: it can change in the future and is thus not recommended
    for production code.
