title: Bug in the resolution of if-expressions
description: |
    This fixes name resolution of if-expressions, in particular when the
    branches have different but compatible types. For example, type-checking
    would previously fail in some situations where the ``then`` branch has
    type ``T'Class`` and the else branch has type ``U'Class`` where ``U``
    derives from ``T``.
