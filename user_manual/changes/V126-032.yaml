title: Fix ``P_Get_Primitives`` with interfaces
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where the ``P_Get_Primitives`` property would miss
    some primitives in the following pattern:

    .. code:: ada

        type I is interface
        procedure Foo (X : I) is abstract;   -- (1)

        type R is tagged null record;
        procedure Foo (X : T) is null;       -- (2)

        type T is new R and I with null record;
        --  Calling `P_Get_Primitives` on T used to return an empty result,
        --  it now correctly returns Foo (2).
