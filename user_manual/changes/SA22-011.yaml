title: Resolution of calls to entries of ``SingleTaskTypeDecl``

description: |
    So far name resolution was failing on calls to an entry defined in a
    ``Task`` declaration (not a task type declaration). This was because
    ``SingleTaskTypeDecl`` would not reimplement the ``defining_env`` primitive
    which we use to retrieve names defined by this type. This change provides
    the implementation of this primitive for a ``SingleTaskTypeDecl`` node.
