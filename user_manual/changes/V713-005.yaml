title: Improve ``get_aspect`` for ``pragma Convention``
description: |
    Previously, calling ``get_aspect("Convention")`` on the declaration of
    ``X`` in the snippet below would return an ``Aspect`` struct whose
    ``value`` field would contain the identifier ``X``:

    ..code:: ada

        X : Integer;
        pragma Convention (C, X);

    It will now return ``C``, because that's what would have been returned if
    one had used the Ada 2012 aspect notation instead:

    ..code:: ada

        X : Integer
            with Convention => C;
