title: Fix ``doc``'s leading whitespace stripping

description: |
    The ``p_doc`` property previously stripped leading whitespace according to
    the leading whitespace of the first line, and raised a ``Property_Error` if
    that caused stripping non whitespace characters on subsequent lines. Now,
    it takes the least indented line as a reference for stripping.
