title: Name resolution support for ``Put_Image`` attribute
description: |
    This change adds name resolution support for the Ada 2020 ``Put_Image``
    attribute. In particular, if the attribute is explicitly defined on a type
    ``Foo_Type`` through an aspect specifcation or attribute definition clause,
    the ``Put_Image`` identifier in an expression ``Foo_Type'Put_Image (...)``
    will correctly reference the subprogram given to the aspect.
