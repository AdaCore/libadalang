title: Fix nameres of conditional expressions
description: |
  This change addresses an issue where name resolution was previously unable
  to resolve the type of an expression involving a conditional expression (such
  as an if-expression or case-expression), when the expected type of the
  conditional expression could not be deduced from the context but had to be
  inferred from one of the branches of the conditional, as in:

  .. code::ada

     C : constant Natural := 3;
     B : constant Boolean := 1 <= (if True then C else 2);

  Libadalang is now able to propagate the type of ``C`` appearing in the
  then-branch in order to know which comparison operator is being referred to.
