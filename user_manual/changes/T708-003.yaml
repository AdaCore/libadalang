title: Prevent name resolution in ``Convention`` aspect
description: |
    The convention used for an entity, such as ``C`` in the ``Convention => C``
    aspect association was incorrectly resolved to the first visible entity
    named ``C``. This now behaves correctly, meaning the identifier used as the
    convention is never resolved to anything.
