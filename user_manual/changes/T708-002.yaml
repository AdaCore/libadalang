title: Fix name resolution in type contracts
description: |
    Previously, name resolution could fail in type contracts (inside
    aspect associations such as ``Type_Invariant``, ``Predicate``, etc.) when
    references were made to entities defined after the entity on which the
    contract applies. This now behaves as expected.
