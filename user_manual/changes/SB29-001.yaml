title: Fix fully_qualified_name for generic decls

description: |
    Consider the following snippet:

    .. code:: ada

       package Foo is
           generic
           package Bar is
               X : Integer;
           end Bar;

           package My_Bar is new Bar;
       end Foo;

    Previously, calling ``fully_qualified_name`` on the declaration of ``X``
    would return ``Foo.Bar.X`` no matter how ``X`` was retrieved.

    With this change, when the declaration of ``X`` is reached from an
    instantiation of ``Bar`` (e.g. through ``My_Bar.X``),
    ``fully_qualified_name`` will return the qualified name to that particular
    instance of ``X``, i.e. ``Foo.My_Bar.X``.
