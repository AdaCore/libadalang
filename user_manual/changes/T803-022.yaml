title: New abstract class ``CondExpr``

description: |
    We introduce a new abstract base class, ``CondExpr``, from which ``IfExpr``
    and ``CaseExpr`` derive, to map to the Ada Reference Manual notion of
    conditional expression. It exposes one property,
    ``P_Dependent_Expressions``, which returns the list of dependent
    expressions.
