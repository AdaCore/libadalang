Libadalang introduction and high level approach
***********************************************

Welcome to you ! If you are reading this document, you are either interrested
into libadalang, or trying to contribute to it as a developer. This
introduction will go over the high level goals of the project, as well as over
the technical approach that has been chosen to achieve those goals. It is
probably a good idea to read this first, since the approach is not
straightforward, and diving into the code head on might prove difficult.
