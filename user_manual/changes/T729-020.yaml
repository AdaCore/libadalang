title: Add ``p_private_part_decl`` property
description: |
    The current ``p_public_part_decl`` property allows one to retrieve the
    public declaration of a given constant object declaration from its
    private view. However, there was no equivalent property for the other
    way around. This adds the ``p_private_part_decl`` property, which can
    be called on the public declaration of a constant object in order to
    retrieve its completion in the private part.
