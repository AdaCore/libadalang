title: Reparsing of the ``Standard`` unit
description: |
    It is now impossible to reparse Libadalang's internal analysis unit that is
    used to implement Ada's ``Standard`` built-in package. It used to be
    possible to get this unit from name resolution primitives, and then call
    ``Get_From_File`` on it with the ``Reparse`` flag set, which would destroy
    its tree and completely break name resolution for the whole analysis
    context. This is no longer possible.
