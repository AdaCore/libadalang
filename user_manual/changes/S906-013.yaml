title: Resolve more SPARK specific attributes and pragmas

description: |
    Some SPARK specific pragmas and attributes were not yet resolved.
    The ``Loop_Invariant`` pragma and the ``Loop_Entry`` attribute were not
    resolved correctly. In addition, some bugs wrt. indexing the result of some
    attributes, such as ``'Old/'Loop_Invariant`` have been fixed.
