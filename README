Dependencies
------------

To generate and build the library itself:

- Quex version 0.64.8 - http://sourceforge.net/projects/quex/files/HISTORY/0.64/. 
  Follow the installation guide in the quex README
- The mako template system for python
- Clang-format
- boost options

You will need GNATpython in order to run the testsuite.

To develop comfortably:

- If you want interactive debugging when code is generated, install IPython
- If you want to compute code coverage for the code generator, install
  coverage.py (pip install coverage)
- If you want to check memory issues, the testsuite has an option to track them
  using Valgrind.

To build the documentation:

- Sphinx
- Pygments

Building
--------

First, let's generate code for libadalang itself. In the top-level directory,
run:

$ python ada/build.py

You can also pass a "-c" flag in order to get a code coverage report in the
"coverage" directory.

Then, let's build it:

$ make -C build -j8

If you satisfied all the above dependencies and if you did set QUEX_PATH and
the quex executable as said in quex's README, it should build fine.

Testing
-------

In the top-level directory, run:

$ python testsuite.py

If you want to learn more about this test driver's options (for instance to run
tests under Valgrind), add a "-h" flag.

Documentation
-------------

The developer's documentation for the project is in doc/dev_guide. You can
consult it as a text files or you can build it.  For instance, to generate HTML
documents, run from the top directory:

$ make -C doc/dev_guide html

And then open the following file in your favorite browser:

    doc/dev_guide/_build/html/index.html
