title: Robustness of top-level subprogram navigation
description: |
    This change modifies the way the specs of top-level subprograms bodies are
    resolved so as to minimize the chances of an exception being raised, by
    exploiting the fact that such subprograms cannot be overloaded and
    therefore their types need not be resolved. In turn, this improves the
    robustness of ``P_Imported_Units`` and indirectly of
    ``P_Find_All_References``.
