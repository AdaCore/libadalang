title: New Origin_Filename and Origin_Charset functions

description: |
    The ``Libadalang.Common`` packages defines two new primitives for
    ``Token_Reference``. The ``Origin_Filename`` function returns the name of
    the file from which the token was extracted, or an empty string if it comes
    from a memory buffer. The ``Origin_Charset`` function returns the name of
    the encoding used to decode the source buffer from which the token was
    extracted, or an empty string if the source buffer was already decoded.
