title: Subtypes with inherited user-defined indexing
description: |
    This change fixes a bug in Libadalang's name resolution mechanism where
    user-defined indexing on a type would not be propagated to its subtypes,
    which in turn would make name resolution fail on expressions involving
    indexing of an instance of such a subtype.
