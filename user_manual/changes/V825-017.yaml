title: Fix inherited primitives equality and hashing
description: |
  Primitive subprograms inherited from a root primitive would not have correct
  computation of identity functions such as equality and hashing, and instead,
  derived primitives would be considered equivalent to the root primitive they
  were derived from. This is now fixed.
