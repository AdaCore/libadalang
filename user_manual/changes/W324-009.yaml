title: Nameres array indexing after access-to-function call
description: |
  This change fixes a bug where name resolution would fail on expressions
  involving an array indexing when the array is the result of a call to
  an access-to-subprogram object, as illustrated by the following example:

  .. code:: ada

     type Arr is array (Positive range <>) of Integer;

     function Bar
       (F : access function (X : Positive) return Arr) return Integer
     is
     begin
        return F (2) (1); --  name resolution failure here
     end Bar;
