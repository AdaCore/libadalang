title: Fix ``parent_basic_decl`` in nested generic contexts
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where calling the ``p_parent_basic_decl`` property
    on a node in a nested generic context (with at least two layers of
    generics) could return a node in an incoherent state. Further queries on
    that node could raise a PropertyError ``Old_Env presents twice in
    rebindings``.
