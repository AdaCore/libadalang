title: Navigation of subprograms with anonymous access parameters
short_title: Subprograms with anonymous access parameters

description: |
    Navigation, for example through ``p_canonical_part``, was broken when
    used on subprograms that themselves take as parameter an anonymous
    access on another subprogram. This was fixed by handling anonymous
    access on subprograms in a piece of logic that previously would
    take them into account.
