title: Fix withing child packages of renamed packages
description: |
    Withing a child unit of a library level package renaming would not work, as
    in:

    .. code-block:: ada

        package Foo is
        end Foo;

        package Foo.Bar is
        end Bar;

        package Foo_Renaming renames Foo;

        with Foo_Renaming.Bar; --  Would not work

    This is now solved.
