    This test checks the formatting of a simple record type
    declaration with discriminants and one component.
    It is expected to break after `is` and `record` keywords
    and before `end record`; the `record` and `end record` are
    indented with a line continuation indentation and aligned;
    the component is indented with a line continuation indentation
    relative to record keyword starting point.
