title: Improve ``BasicDecl``/``DefiningName`` APIs

description: |
    Some properties of ``BasicDecl`, namely ``p_unique_identifying_name``,
    ``p_fully_qualified_name``, ``p_canonical_fully_qualified_name``, make
    little sense when applied to basic declarations with several names, such as
    object declarations or parameter specifications.

    .. code-block:: ada

        A, B : Integer;

    Those properties will now raise an error when used on declarations
    declaring several objects as above, and equivalent properties have been
    exposed on ``DefiningName``, which should from now on be favored.
