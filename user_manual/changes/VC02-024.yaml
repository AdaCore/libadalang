title: Fix ``P_Fully_Qualified_Name`` on formal decls
description: |
    On the following snippet:

    .. code:: ada

        generic
            Obj : Integer;
        package Pkg is
        end Pkg;

        package My_Pkg is new Pkg (1);

    Navigating inside ``My_Pkg`` through the instantiation of ``Pkg`` and
    querying the fully qualified name of ``Obj`` used to return ``Pkg.Obj``,
    not taking into account the generic context. It now returns ``My_Pkg.Obj``.
    Note that in this example Ada does not allow accessing ``My_Pkg.Obj`` from
    the enclosing package, however there are certain scenarios in which this is
    allowed (e.g. with generic formal packages) and therefore the old behavior
    would return invalid results for those legal cases.
