title: Fix precedence of fields over subprograms
description: |
    In the scenario of a tagged record type having a field ``Foo`` as well as
    a method ``Foo`` with a profile such that ``X.Foo`` could be seen as
    ambiguous, Ada resolves the ambiguity by always choosing the field access.
    This was not implemented by Libadalang, meaning it could in such cases
    resolve to the subprogram instead of the field. This change implements the
    correct behavior.
