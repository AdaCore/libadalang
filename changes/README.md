Libadalang changes directory
============================

This directory contains descriptions for changes in Libadalang. Each change is
summarized in a yaml file. There are three types of changes: new features, API
changes, and bug fixes.

The contents are used for two purposes:

1. Create changelogs in Libadalang docs.
2. Provide traceability for issues inside of AdaCore.

To see what should be documented in each yaml entry, please see
[entry_schema.yaml](./entry_schema.yaml), which uses the [json
schema](https://json-schema.org/) schema description, but with yaml objects.
