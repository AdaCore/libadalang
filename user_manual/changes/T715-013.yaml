title: Nameres call to incomplete types' primitives
description: |
    Name resolution could crash when trying to resolve a call to a primitive
    of a type when a primitive of the same name but defined on a different
    incomplete type is visible. In that case, the first visible primitive
    would always be chosen, which is erroneous if a call to the second one
    was intended.
