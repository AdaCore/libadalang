title: Fix ``find_all_references`` in generic contexts
description: |
  This patch fixes the ``find_all_references`` property (when used with
  ``Follow_Renamings``), where internal entities comparison may fail because of
  the presence of rebindings information. Since rebindings are not relevant in
  that context, we just compare entities without them now.
