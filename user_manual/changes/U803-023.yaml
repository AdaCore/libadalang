title: Add support for "at clauses" in ``P_Get_Aspect``
description: |
    This change adds support for the Ada 83 "at clause" construct in
    ``P_Get_Aspect``, as this construct can be used to define the ``Address``
    aspect on an object. Thus, if the clause ``for X use at E;`` appears in the
    declarative scope of ``X``, calling ``P_Get_Aspect("Address")`` on the
    declaration of ``X`` will return it.

    This change also adds the ``P_Get_At_clause`` property which, given a
    declaration, returns the "at clause" defined for it if it exists.
