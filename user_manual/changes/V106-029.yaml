title: Fix ``get_primitives`` with generic base types
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where calling ``p_get_primitives`` on a type
    inheriting from a type defined in an instantiaged generic package
    would behave wrongly, as it would in some cases completely omit the
    primitives associated with such base types.
