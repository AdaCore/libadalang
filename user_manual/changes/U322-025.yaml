title: Missing Numeric_Error declaration from standard
description: |
    This change adds the missing ``Numeric_Error`` exception declaration into
    Libadalang's ``standard`` package so that it is available in every
    analysis unit. This fixes bugs where references to ``Numeric_Error`` would
    not be resolved correctly.
