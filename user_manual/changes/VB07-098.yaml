title: Change the structure of ``AcceptStmt`` nodes

description: |
    Accept statements are a weird beast in Ada, in that they both look like
    subprogram bodies and like composite statements.

    Similar to named loops, they'll allow you to fully qualify the names of
    entities declared inside of them. Also you might expect to be able to
    navigate to them from the entry declaration.

    For that reason, the Libadalang tree has been modified so that Accept
    statements now include a body declaration, so that the following accept
    statement:

    .. code-block:: ada

        accept Foo;

    Will produce the following tree:

    .. code-block::

        AcceptStmt
        |name:
        |  DefiningName
        |  |name:
        |  |  Id "Foo"
        |entry_index_expr: None
        |params:
        |  EntryCompletionFormalParams
        |  |params: None
        |body_decl:
        |  AcceptStmtBody ["Foo"]

    This in turns allow both fully qualifying entities declared in them, as
    well as navigating to the first accept statement corresponding to an entry
    via the `P_Next_Part`/`P_Body_Part` properties.
