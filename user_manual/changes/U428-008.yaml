title: Generalize ``p_canonical_text`` to ``Name`` nodes
description: |
    So far, ``p_canonical_text`` was only available on names made of a single
    token (e.g. ``Identifier``). This change generalizes the implementation to
    work on simple names (``Identifier``, ``DottedName`` and ``DefiningName``).
