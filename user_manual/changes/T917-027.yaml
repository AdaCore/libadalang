title: Fix parsing of ``Wide_*Image`` attributes
description: |
    Until now, such attributes would be parsed differently that the basic
    ``Image`` attribute. For example, ``Type'Image (X)`` would be parsed
    as a simple AttributeRef node with arguments, whereas
    ``Type'Wide_Image (X)`` would be parsed as a call to ``Type'Wide_Image``.
    Since we don't currently support function attributes, this change unifies
    the representations by making the second case behave like the first one.
