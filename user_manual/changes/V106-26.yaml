title: Fix resolution of ``pragma Assert`` statements
description: |
    Name resolution of pragma ``Assert`` was previously incomplete: the second
    argument of the pragma, describing the message to be associated with the
    raised exception was not resolved although it can contain an arbitrary
    expression returning a ``String``.
