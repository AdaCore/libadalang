title: New SPARK related properties on subprograms
description: |

  This change introduces new properties on subprogram decls & bodies:

  .. code-block::

     SubpBody.is_subject_to_proof()``:
     """
     Returns whether this subprogram body is subject to proof in the context of
     the SPARK/GNATprove tools.
     """

     SubpDecl/SubpBody.has_spark_mode_on():
     """
     Returns whether this subprogram has explicitly been set as having
     ``Spark_Mode`` to ``On``, directly or indirectly.

     Doesn't include subprograms that can be inferred by GNATprove as being
     SPARK.
