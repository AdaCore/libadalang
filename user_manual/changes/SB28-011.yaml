title: More helpful error message for ``As_*`` node converters
apis: ["ada"]
description: |
    ``As_*`` node conversion functions raise a ``Constraint_Error` when the
    input value does not fit in the output type. The message attached to this
    exception has been enhanced to contain input/output type information and
    mention Libadalang, so that it is easier to investigate complex code
    raising such ``Constraint_Error`` exceptions.
