# Test that name resolution behaves as expected in the case of a non visible
# dependency in a library level subprogram body.
#
# This test was added because of a bug in the unit_requested callback mechanism
# (a warning would be emitted when LAL was looking for a non visible dependency
# through the spec of a library level subprogram body), but is generally useful
# to exert the code path where we look for withed units through the spec of a
# library level subprogram body.
