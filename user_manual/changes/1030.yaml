title: Fix private-with visibility in child units
description: |
  This change fixes a bug where child units were previously assumed to always
  have view on ``private with`` clauses of their parent unit, which is not the
  case in their public part. This could cause name resolution to incorrectly
  resolve names to entities that were not supposed to be visible.
