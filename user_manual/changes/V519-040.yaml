title: On-demand synthesis of character literals
description: |
  Since we cannot add all existing character literals in the lexical
  environments due to their number (think about ``Wide_Wide_Character``), a
  character literal that is not user defined was resolved to ``None``. This new
  feature fixes this issue by synthesizing the required literal, on-demand.
