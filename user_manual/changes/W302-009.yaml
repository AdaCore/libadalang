title: Improve performance of sequenced dot calls
description: |
  This change implements an optimization inside the name resolution mechanism
  to avoid unnecessary computations when resolving a call with the dot
  notation. While unnoticeable on small sequences, chaining dozens of them
  could rapidly become abnormally slow. It should now behave about the same as
  calls done without the dot notation.
