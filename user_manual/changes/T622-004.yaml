    New properties for associating formal parameters to actual or default
    expressions.
short_title: Formal params to actuals or defaults
description: |
    Add the new properties ``Name.call_params``,
    ``GenericInstantiation.inst_params``, and
    ``BaseAggregate.aggregate_params``. Those properties, when called on a
    ``Name`` denoting a call expression, a generic instantiation, or an
    aggregate, return an array of parameter-expression pair (the ``ParamActual``
    struct is used to hold this pair of ``DefiningName`` and ``Expr`` nodes).
    They return all the parameters of the function (or generic
    instantiation/aggregate), even those that are not provided explicitly by the
    call (or the generic instantiation). In that case, the expression associated
    with that parameter is the default expression defined by the function or
    generic specification.
