function Is_Keyword
  (Token   : Token_Reference;
   Version : Language_Version) return Boolean;
--  Given an Ada language version, return whether ``Token`` is an Ada keyword.
--
--  Due to the way Libadalang works, every token added after Ada 83 is lexed
--  as a regular identifier, and then treated specially by the parser in
--  some circumstances (being akin to the notion of reserved word).
--
--  This function returns True for regular lexer keywords, as well as for those
--  identifiers.
