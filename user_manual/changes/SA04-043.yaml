title: Handle missing standard & implementation defined attributes

description: |
    We implemented name resolution for a lot of attributes that were missing,
    both standard and implementation defined. The common characteristic is
    being supported by GNAT.

    Here is the full list: ``Ceiling``, ``Floor``, ``Rounding``, ``Callable``,
    ``Type_Class``, ``Storage_Pool``, ``Width``, ``Component_Size``,
    ``Position``, ``Mantissa``, ``Model_Mantissa``, ``Machine_Mantissa``,
    ``Fore``, ``Aft``, ``Digits``, ``Modulus``, ``Epsilon``, ``Model_Epsilon``,
    ``Safe_Large``, ``Safe_Small``.

    In addition, resolution for unhandled attributes now fails explicitly.
