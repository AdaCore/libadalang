Dependencies
------------

- Quex version 0.64.8 - http://sourceforge.net/projects/quex/files/HISTORY/0.64/. 
  Follow the installation guide in the quex README
- The mako template system for python
- Clang-format
- boost options
- If you want interactive debugging when code is generated, install IPython
- If you want to compute code coverage for the code generator, install
  coverage.py (pip install coverage)

Building
--------

First, let's generate code for libadalang itself. In the top-level directory,
run:

$ python compiler/build.py

You can also pass a "-c" flag in order to get a code coverage report in the
"coverage" directory.

Then, let's build it:

$ make -C build -j8

If you satisfied all the above dependencies and if you did set QUEX_PATH and
the quex executable as said in quex's README, it should build fine.

Testing
-------

First, make sure your Python 2 installation has access to the "pygments"
package. Still in the top-level directory, run:

$ python tests/driver.py

If you want to learn more about this test driver's options (for instance to run
tests under Valgrind), add a "-h" flag.
