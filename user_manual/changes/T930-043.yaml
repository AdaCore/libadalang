title: Add ``BaseFormalParamHolder.formal_params`` property
description: |
    This new property allows the user to get a flat list of parameters (as a
    ``DefiningName`` array), no matter they are declared in the same parameter
    specification (i.e. packed) or not. When called on a record component list,
    this property doesn't return variants nor discriminants.
