title: Fix implementation of ``is_dispatching_call``
description: |
    This change fills a hole in the implementation of ``is_dispatching_call``,
    where calls with tag-indeterminate operands but a controlling result could
    only be considered dispatching in the context of an assignment, but not
    when an enclosing call could be used to determine its controlling tag
    value.
