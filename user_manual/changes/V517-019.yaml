title: Aspects are associated with defining names
description: |
    This change reworks the way aspects (aspect associations, pragmas and
    representation clauses) are exposed in Libadalang. They were previously
    associated with ``BasicDecl`` nodes, but since basic declarations allow
    multiple defining names and aspects can be defined on a single one of
    them, the ``P_Has_Aspect`` property and other similar properties defined
    on ``BasicDecl`` were not fine-grain enough. This change fixes that by
    introducing those properties on ``DefiningName``. Their ``BasicDecl``
    versions now raise an exception when called on declarations with multiple
    defining names. Moreover, the ``Pragma.P_Associated_Decls`` property has
    been renamed to ``Pragma.P_Associated_Entities`` and returns a list of
    defining names instead of a list of declarations.
