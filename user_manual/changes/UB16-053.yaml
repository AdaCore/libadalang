title: Synthesize predefined operators
description: |
    This work introduces synthesized operators in Libadalang's lexical
    scopes, so as to make them available for its name resolution mechanism.
    This enables resolution of direct references to operators (e.g.
    ``Standard."+"``) used in generic instantiations, subprogram renamings,
    etc. However, these are not used for resolution of arbitrary binary or
    unary operations yet.
