title: Fix ``P_Base_Subp_Declarations`` for derived types
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where calling ``P_Base_Subp_Declarations`` on an
    overriding subprogram declared in a non-package scope for a derived type T
    would not have the subprogram itself in the returned array, not matching
    what is stated in the documentation.
