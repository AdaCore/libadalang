title: Imprecise fallback on suffix of dotted names
description: |
    Until now, the imprecise fallback of nameres queries such as
    ``p_referenced_decl`` would never behave correctly when called on the
    suffix of dotted names (e.g. ``Subprogram`` in ``Pkg.Subprogram``).
    The fallback should now provide better results.
