title: Full name resolution of character literals
description: |
    This change completes the implementation of name resolution for character
    literals which was previously lacking one of the behaviors described in
    Ada RM 4.2 (3), which is that the expected type of the character literal
    can be used to determine which EnumLiteralDecl it refers to.
