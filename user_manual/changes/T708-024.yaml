title: Fix name resolution crash on runtime files
description: |
    Name resolution would crash when trying to analyze the following files
    from the runtime: a-stzfix.ads a-stzhas.ads a-szfzha.ads. The pattern
    leading to the crash was identified and was fixed altogether, thus name
    resolution will not be affected by new occurrences of it.
