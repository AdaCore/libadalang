title: Load implicitly-withed runtime units when needed
description: |
    Some runtime units such as ``Ada.Exceptions``, ``Ada.Tags``,
    ``Ada.Task_Identification``, and a few others need to be loaded in order
    for libadalang to provide correct name resolution on constructs that refer
    or type to declarations from those units, which was not done beforehand.
    This change fixes that by loading those units as soon as it's necessary.
