title: Invalid object cast with `P_Is_Dispatching_Call`
description: |
    Calling the `P_Is_Dispatching_Call` property could sometimes crash with
    an ``Invalid object cast`` error, which was due to an erroneous
    assumption made in the implementation of that property. This change
    fixes it.
