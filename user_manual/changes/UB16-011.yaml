title: Fix navigation on declarations with multiple ids
description: |
    This change implements proper navigation on basic declarations that
    have multiple defining identifiers. Previously, navigation properties
    such as ``DefiningName.p_next_part`` or ``DefiningName.p_previous_part``
    could not handle cases where the target basic declaration could depend
    on which defining name the navigation property was called on. For example:

    .. code:: ada

        package Pkg is
            X, Y : constant Integer;
        private
            X : constant Integer := 1;
            Y : constant Integer := 2;
        end Pkg;

    Calling ``p_next_part`` on ``Y`` in the public part used to return None,
    whereas it now correctly returns the completion of ``Y`` in the private
    part. The same problem was identified on subprogram parameters, and was
    fixed as well.
