title: Handle ``others`` designator in zip_with_params
description: |
    So far, zip_with_params would completely leave out the ``others``
    designator in an assoc list, not providing any binding for it in the
    resulting array. Now, it will return one additional binding per unmatched
    parameter, from that parameter to the expression associated to ``others``.
