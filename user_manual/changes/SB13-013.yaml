title: Crash when resolving ambiguous case stmts

description: |
    Consider the following code pattern:

    .. code:: ada

        function Foo return Integer;
        procedure Foo;

        ...

        case Foo is
            when ... => ...
        end case;

    Name resolution would crash here while attempting to construct
    the xref equation for the case statement due to the presence of
    procedure ``Foo``, which by definition has no return type and
    therefore would provoke a null dereference. This is now fixed.
