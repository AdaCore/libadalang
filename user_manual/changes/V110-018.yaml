type: bugfix
title: Enhance discovery of inherited primitives
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where subprograms declared in a non package scope
    next to a derived type would be tagged as primitive of this type as soon
    as the signature allowed it. The correct behavior is now implemented, which
    is that those subprograms are tagged as primitives only if they override an
    inherited primitive of the derived type's base type.
