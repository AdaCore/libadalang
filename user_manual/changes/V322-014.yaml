title: Spurious "missing file" event for generic package instantiations
short_title: Spurious "missing file" event for generic pkg. inst.
description: |
   Calling the ``BasicDecl.p_next_part_for_basic_decl`` property on a generic
   package instantiation raised a "missing file" event, pretending that this is
   an error. This is not correct, as generic package instantiations do not have
   bodies. This is no longer tagged as an error.
