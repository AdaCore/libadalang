title: Fix name resolution of ``Mod`` attribute
description: |
    Until now, the ``Mod`` attribute would take an incorrect code path during
    name resolution, which could make some expressions involving it fail to
    resolve. In particular in expressions where the mod attribute is used as
    one of the operand of an arithmetic operation.
