title: Resolve formal in discriminant constraint
description: |
    Libadalang now correctly resolves references to the discriminant inside
    discriminant constraints, as in:

    .. code:: ada
        type R (X : Integer) is null record;
        type R_Access is access T;

        subtype T is R_Access (X => 12);
        --                     ^ This reference is now resolved
