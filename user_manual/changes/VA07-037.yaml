title: "``Libadalang.Config_Pragmas``: class-wide ``Project_Tree`` formals"
short_title: "Project_Tree'Class in Libadalang.Config_Pragmas"
description: |
    Make subprograms that accept ``GNATCOLL.Project.Project_Tree`` formals
    actually take ``Project_Tree'Class`` values. This makes it easier for
    Libadalang users to interact with the ``Project_Tree_Access`` type from
    ``GNATCOLL.Projects``, which is an access to the class-wide type.
