title: Resolution of separate generic subprograms

description: |
    So far name resolution would fail when trying to resolve references to
    generic parameters in the body of separate generic subprogram. That was
    because the lexical env containing the generic parameters was not
    accessible from within the separate. This change fixes this by weakening
    the condition necessary to add a referenced_env to the generic formal
    part, which separate bodies now satisfy.
