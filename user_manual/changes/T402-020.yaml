title: Add failsafe ``referenced_decl/name`` properties

description: |
    Add ``Name.failsafe_referenced_decl`` and
    ``Name.failsafe_referenced_def_name`` properties. Those properties act like
    their non failsafe counterpart, except that they'll never raise an
    exception, and they will track in the result whether it was found through
    precise or imprecise resolution.

    Note that for most purposes, those are purely better version of
    `referenced_decl`` and ``referenced_defining_name``, should be used in
    priority, and might replace those in a future version of LAL.
