title: Fix ``P_Get_Primitives`` when param names differ
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where ``P_Get_Primitives`` would previously
    consider that a subprogram does not override its base subprogram when the
    names of the parameters didn't match. In those cases, both the base
    subprogram and its override would appear in the resulting list, whereas we
    only expect the most overriden one to appear.
