title: Invalid xref for overloaded enclosing subprogram
description: |
    This change fixes a bug in the following code pattern:

    .. code:: ada

        procedure Foo is null;
        procedure Foo (X : Integer) is
        begin
            Foo;  -- this used to resolve to the enclosing subprogram
        end Foo;

    The call to ``Foo`` now correctly resolve to the first subprogram
    declaration.
