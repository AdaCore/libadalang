title: Fix ``p_is_call`` on qualified subprogram name
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where a qualified subprogram name could be wrongly
    tagged as a call, as in the following example:

    .. code:: ada

        function Foo (X : Integer) return Integer is
        begin
            return Foo.X;  -- `Foo` was wrongly considered a call
        end Foo;
