title: Make subtype_mark optional in object renames
description: |
    The subtype_mark in object renaming declarations is made optional as per
    AI12-0275 (Ada 2022 feature). To achieve this goal, a new node type has
    been introduced: `NoTypeObjectRenamingDecl`, derived from `ObjectDecl`,
    it allows to create such an object without type expression.
