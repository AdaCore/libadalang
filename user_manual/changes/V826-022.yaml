title: Fix ``P_Is_Dispatching_Call`` on non-tagged types
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where LAL could incorrectly flag some calls as
    dispatching when the callee was a primitive of a non-tagged type. It
    now makes sure a tagged type is involved before processing the call
    further.
