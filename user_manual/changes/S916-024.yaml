type: bugfix
title: Package navigation in presence of homonyms
description: |
    Before this change, the ``p_package_previous_part`` private property
    would return a wrong result when applied on given package if this package
    contained a entity with the same name as the package itself. These wrong
    results would then propagate to common navigation properties such as
    ``p_decl_part``.
