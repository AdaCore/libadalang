    This test checks the formatting of an anonymous array type declaration with
    multiple indices.
    It is expected the declaration breaks before `of` keywords and the new
    line to have the same indentation as the `array` keyword.
    Is is also expected that the indices have continuation line indentation
    relative to where the `array` keyword ends.
