title: Add node iterator predicate ``Kind_In``

description: |
    The new ``Kind_In`` node predicate in the ``Libadalang.Iterators`` API
    allows one to filter nodes whose kind is in a given range. This makes it
    easy to look for nodes that derive from an abstract type. For instance, the
    following iterator will return all nodes that derive from ``Basic_Decl``.

    .. code-block:: ada

       Find (Root, Kind_In (Ada_Basic_Decl'First, Ada_Basic_Decl'Last));
