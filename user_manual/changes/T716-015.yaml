title: Add xref for stream attributes references
description: |
    From now on, stream attributes in stream attribute references such as in
    ``R'Output (S, X)`` resolve to the declaration of the subprogram used as
    override for the corresponding attribute, if it has been set with the
    appropriate attribute def clause. Otherwise, it still resolves to None,
    indicating that the attribute has not been overridden.
