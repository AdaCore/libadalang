title: Handle static object renamings.
description: |
    Previously, LAL would never consider an object renaming a static
    declaration, even when its renamed entity was static. This fix changes
    the behavior of ``p_is_static_decl`` (and transitively that of
    ``p_is_static_expr``) to take this case into account, and also updates
    the static expression evaluator accordingly.
