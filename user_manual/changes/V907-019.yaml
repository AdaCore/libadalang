title: Component have precedence when using dot notation
description: |
    This change fixes a bug in LAL name resolution where a dotted name such as
    ``X.F`` for some record ``X`` with a component ``F`` as well as a
    subprogram named ``F`` callable using the dot notation could in some cases
    resolve to the subprogram instead of the component, when the inverse was
    expected.
