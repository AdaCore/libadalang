title: Rename --exit-on-missing-file command line argument
description: |
    This change renames App's ``--exit-on-missing-file`` built in command line
    argument to ``--keep-going-on-missing-file``. This inverts the semantics
    for this flag: when a source file is missing, the App exits with an error
    by default, and it just emits a warning and keeps going when the flag is
    passed.
