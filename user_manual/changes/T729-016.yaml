title: Name resolution robustness of if/case stmts
description: |
    Previously, the entire name resolution of an if stmt or case stmt would
    fail whenever any of their alternatives' resolution would fail. Each
    alternative is now resolved independently, so that a failing one does not
    impact the others. Note that this change does not impact resolution of
    if/case expressions.
