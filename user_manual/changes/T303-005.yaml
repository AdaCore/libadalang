title: Preserve casing in fully_qualified_name output
description: |
    So far, the ``p_fully_qualified_name`` would always output the fully
    qualified name as a string in lower case. This fixes it by reusing
    the casing of the names that compose the fully qualified name as they
    appear in the source code.
