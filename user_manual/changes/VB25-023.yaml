title: Fix ``BasicDecl.relative_name`` on synthetic decls
description: |
    Before this change, ``Name.relative_name`` did return a ``SingleTokNode``,
    which made it impossible for it to return ``SyntheticIdentifiers``, which
    are valid relative names for synthetic entities.

    This change changes the signature of ``relative_name`` so that it returns a
    ``Name`` instead. To get the symbol corresponding to the returned name, you
    can call ``Name.name_symbol`` on it.
