title: Handle renaming clauses in ``Find_All_*`` queries
description: |
    This change adds an optional ``Through_Renamings`` parameter to
    ``Find_All_References`` and ``Find_All_Calls`` properties, which when set
    to True will make sure the results of those queries includes references
    or calls made to entities that rename the original entity (with renaming
    chains of arbitrary length).
