title: Resolution of top-level child generic subp bodies.

description: |
    So far name resolution could fail in certain cases when trying to resolve
    references inside a top-level generic child subprogram body, in particular
    those that would refer to names declared in the private part of the parent
    unit, because the body would not have full visibility on the parent.
    This change fixes this by adjusting the env spec of generic subp decls to
    rectify the parent env.
