    This test checks the formatting of a protected type declaration
    with known discriminant, aspects and public.
    It is expected the declaration breaks before the discriminant
    specification, before `with` and `is` keywords and be formatted
    by indenting the discriminant specification, the aspects and the
    public part content and keeping the `protected`, `is` and `end`
    keywords aligned.
