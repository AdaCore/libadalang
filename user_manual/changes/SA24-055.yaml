title: Nameres crash with calls on shadowed types

description: |
    In case a type was shadowed by an object, resolving a call on that
    object could crash because the construction of the xref equation
    would assume the type was a possible target for the call. This was
    fixed by early discarding types when resolving calls in which the
    context does not allow a type.
