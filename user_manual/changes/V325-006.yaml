title: Fix exponentiation in Ada integer literal decoding
description: |
  Libadalangâ€™s decoder for integer literals (the
  ``Libadalang.Sources.Decode_Integer_Literal`` procedure) applied the exponent
  in base 10 regardless of the base of the literal being evaluated. This is
  wrong, as the ARM (2.4.2) states:

    An exponent indicates the power of the base by which the value of the
    based_literal without the exponent is to be multiplied to obtain the value
    of the based_literal with the exponent.
