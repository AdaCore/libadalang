title: Make end names always refer to their body
description: |
    This change fixes a discrepancy in the behavior of name resolution on
    end names: an end name of a subprogram body would resolve to the body
    itself, whereas for a package body it would resolve to the package
    declaration. It now always resolve to the body.

    As a side-effect, this change fixes a bug where the end name of an entity
    ``X`` could be wrongly resolved to an entity declared inside ``X`` in case
    that entity  was also named ``X``. The following snippet illustrates the
    error case:

    .. code:: ada

        package body Foo is
            procedure Foo is
            begin
                null;
            end Foo;
        end Foo;

    In this example, the identifier ``Foo`` in the end name of the package
    would resolve to the procedure body instead of its corresponding
    package body.
