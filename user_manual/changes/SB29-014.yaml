title: Resolve defaults for generic formal subprograms

description: |
    Defaults for generic formal subprograms were not correctly resolved, and
    would cause crashes when trying to find the referenced declaration.

    .. code:: ada

        procedure Foo;

        generic
            with procedure Bar is Foo;
            --                    ^ Not resolved
        package Baz is
        end Baz;
