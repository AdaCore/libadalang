title: Source location information for decoding errors
description: |
    The diagnostic that is emitted for source decoding errors (for instance
    "Could not decode source as UTF-8") used to have no source location
    information, making it hard for Libadalang users to locate where the
    invalid sequence of bytes is in the source. This diagnostic now is
    associated to the source location corresponding to the place where source
    decoding stopped.
