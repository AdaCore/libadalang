title: Fix ``P_Is_Derived_Type`` on subtypes with interfaces
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where calling ``P_Is_Derived_Type`` could
    incorrectly return False in the following situation:

    .. note:: ada

        type I1 is interface;
        type I2 is interface and I1;
        subtype S_I2 is I2;
        subtype S_I2_CW is S_I2'Class;

    Previously, invoking ``P_Is_Derived_Type`` to find out if ``S_I2_CW``
    deived from ``I1`` would return False. It now correctly returns True.
