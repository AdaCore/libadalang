    This test checks the formatting of a use package clause having
    a list of package names exceeding the maximal line length.
    The packages are designated by dotted and simple names with
    different casing.
    It is expected to break after the comma, align on the first
    element of the package list and keep the casing unchanged.
    The long dotted name will be formatted as expected (namely, a
    line break is inserted before . and the alignment is based on
    the initial position of the first field and a line continuation
    indentation (i.e., 2 spaces) is added before . on each new line.
