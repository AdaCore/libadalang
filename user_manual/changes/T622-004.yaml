    New properties for associating formal parameters to actual or default
    expressions.
short_title: Formal params to actuals or defaults
description: |
    Add the new properties ``Name.call_params``,
    ``GenericInstantiation.inst_params``, ``BaseAggregate.aggregate_params``,
    ``SubtypeIndication.subtype_constraints``, and ``EnumRepClause.params``.
    Those properties, when called on a ``Name`` denoting a call expression, a
    generic instantiation, an aggregate, a subtype discriminants list, or an
    enum representation clause, return an array of parameter-expression pair
    (the ``ParamActual`` struct is used to hold this pair of ``DefiningName``
    and ``Expr`` nodes). They return all the parameters of the function (or
    generic instantiation/aggregate/discriminants list), even those that are not
    provided explicitly by the call (the generic instantiation, or the
    discriminants list). In that case, the expression associated with that
    parameter is the default expression defined by the function, generic or
    discriminants specification.
