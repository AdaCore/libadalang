title: Improve implementation of ``P_Is_Ghost_Code``
description: |
    This change fixes a number of problems in the previous implementation
    of ``P_Is_Ghost_Code``:

    * Adds ``P_Is_Ghost_Code`` property on aspect associations, which
      returns True on Ada 2012 contract aspects (Pre, Post, etc).
    * Renamings of ghost entities are now considered ghost themselves.
    * Instantiations of ghost generic entities are now considered ghost
      themselves.
    * pragma ``Assert_And_Cut`` is also a ghost pragma.
