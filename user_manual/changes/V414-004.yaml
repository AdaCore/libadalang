title: Fix parsing of pragma in a case statement
description: |
    Libadalang used to reject pragma statements that appeared before the first
    alternative:

    .. code-block:: ada

       case Foo is
           pragma Assert (True);
           when A => null;
           when B => null;
       end case;

    This is valid Ada, so it is now accepted.
