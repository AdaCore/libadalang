title: Fix defining name's navigation queries crash
description: |
    Previously, any navigation property (next_part, previous_part, etc.)
    called on a defining name would crash whenever its associated basic
    decl would not have the requested part. As such, calling p_next_part
    on the defining name of an abstract subprogram would always crash.
