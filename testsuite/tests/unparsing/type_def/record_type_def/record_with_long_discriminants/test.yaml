    This test checks the formatting of a simple record type
    declaration with long discriminants and one component.
    It is expected to break before `(`, `is` and `record` keywords
    and `end record` and after `record`; the `type` and `is` keywords
    are aligned, the `record` and `end record` are indented with a
    line continuation indentation and aligned; the component is
    indented with a line continuation indentation relative to record
    keyword starting point; the discriminant is indented with a line
    continuation indentation relative to `type` keyword starting point
    and splitted in two lines and the discriminant specs are alinged on
    the starting position of the first element.
