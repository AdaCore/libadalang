type: bugfix
title: Make ``Next_Sibling`` and ``Previous_Sibling`` work on root nodes
short_title: Next_Sibling and Previous_Sibling on root nodes
description: |
    The ``Next_Sibling`` and ``Previous_Sibling`` properties used to raise a
    ``Property_Error`` exception when called on root nodes. They now just
    return a null node, and their documentation has been updated to make this
    explicit.
