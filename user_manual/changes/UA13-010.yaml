title: Complete implementation of ``Base_Subp_Declarations``
description: |
    This change adds support for ``P_Base_Subp_Declarations`` on subprograms
    defined in protected types and task types, so that it takes into account
    subprograms coming from their parent interfaces.
    Note that this also fixes the behavior of ``P_Root_Subp_Declarations``.
