title: Nameres end names of homonym packages
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where the end name of a child package ``Pkg.Foo``
    could be incorrectly resolved in case a child package ``Pkg.Foo.Pkg`` was
    also defined: the prefix ``Pkg`` in ``Pkg.Foo`` would be incorrectly bound
    to the ``Pkg`` definition of the child package of ``Foo`` instead of the
    root package.
