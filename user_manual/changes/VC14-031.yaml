title: Fix object decl navigation in instantiated packages
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where calling ``P_Next_Part_For_Decl`` or
    ``P_Previous_Part_For_Decl`` on an ``ObjectDecl`` inside an instantiated
    generic package would return the correct node but would lose the
    information about the current instantiation. Thus, further queries on
    the package would not return the expected results.
