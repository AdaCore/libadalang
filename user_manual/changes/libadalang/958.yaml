type: bugfix
title: Support type predicates self-reference
description: |
  This change fixes name resolution for type predicates such as in:

  .. code-block:: ada

    procedure Test is
      function F (S : String) return Boolean is (True);

      subtype String_T is String (1 .. 99) with
         Dynamic_Predicate => F (String_T (1 .. 90));
      begin
         null;
      end Test;

  where the resolution of the `String_T` object used in the predicate check was
  not correctly resolved.
