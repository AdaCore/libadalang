title: Correct parsing of attribute refs
description: |
    This change fixes a long-standing issue in LAL where would incorrectly
    parse attribute references denoting subprograms. For example, we would
    parse ``Integer'Image (1)`` as a single ``AttributeRef`` node with its
    ``f_args`` field being the literal 1. After this change, this is now
    parsed as a ``CallExpr`` whose ``f_name`` field is the ``AttributeRef``
    without arguments. This also means that name resoltuion will now correctly
    work when an attribute-ref is used in place where a reference to a
    subprogram is expected, such as the target of a subprogram renaming or as
    the actual of a generic instantiation.
