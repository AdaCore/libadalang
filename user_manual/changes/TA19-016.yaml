description: |
    ``DefiningName.find_all_references/calls`` returns ``RefResult`` array,
    which contains the information of whether the reference was obtained via
    precise or imprecise resolution.

    Additionally, exceptions shouldn't be raised as part of the normal control
    flow of those properties, and a name resolution failure won't make them
    stop searching.
