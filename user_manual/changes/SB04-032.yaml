title: P_syntactic_fully_qualified_name can crash in presence of parsing errors

short_title: P_SFQN is vulnerable to parsing errors

description: |
    The ``p_syntactic_fully_qualified_name`` property could crash when called
    on a unit with parsing errors because we didn't handle the case where its
    body would be an ``ErrorDecl``. This is now fixed.
