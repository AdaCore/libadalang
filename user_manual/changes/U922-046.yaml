title: Improve nameres accuracy of dispatching calls
description: |
    This change improves name resolution to always return the most precise
    subprogram declaration for a given dispatching call according to the
    static type. In the following example:

    .. code:: ada

        package Pkg is
            type T is tagged null record;
            procedure Foo (X : T) is null;
        end Pkg;

        package Der is
            type U is new Pkg.T with null record;
            overriding procedure Foo (X : U) is null;
        end Der;

        procedure Main is
            use Pkg;
            use Der;

            X : U'Class := ...;
        begin
            Foo (X);
        end Main;

    Using name resolution to find the subprogram referenced by ``Foo`` could
    previously yield the declaration in ``Pkg`` instead of that in ``Der``,
    depending on the order in which the use clauses were written.
    With this change, the one ``Der`` is always returned since it is the most
    accurate one.
