title: Implement evaluation of fixed point defs' ranges
description: |
    This change improves Libadalang's static expression evaluator to handle
    the ``T'First`` and ``T'Last`` attributes where ``T`` is a fixed point
    type definition. The evaluator will now return a real value corresponding
    to the types's low or high bound. It supports ``Ordinary_Fixed_Point``
    definition where the range is given explicitly, as well as
    ``Decimal_Fixed_Point_Def`` where the range is computed from the type's
    ``delta`` and ``digits`` parameters.
