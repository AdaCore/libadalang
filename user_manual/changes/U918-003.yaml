title: Name resolution of implicit ``/=`` operator
description: |
    Currently, LAL's name resolution mechanism handles references to
    implicit ``/=`` operators used as infix operators of a binary expression,
    but not when they were referenced explicitly in a call expression, as in
    ``"/=" (A, B)``. This change fixes this issue.
