title: More frequent precise element type in field docs

description: |
    Up to now, the documentation for node fields that contain list nodes
    could already include the list of precise types for list elements. For
    instance, the documentation of the ``AbortStmt.f_names`` field, which
    contains "a list of Names" was::

        This field contains a list that itself contains one of the following
        nodes:

        * Attribute_Ref

        * Call_Expr

        * ...

    While this precise type information is useful, it was not always present.
    For instance, the ``GenericSubpInstantiation.f_params`` field, which
    contains ``AssocList`` nodes, i.e. lists of ``BasicAssoc`` nodes, was
    lacking a documentation that states that these ``AssocList`` nodes actually
    contain only ``ParamAssoc`` nodes. This oversight is now fixed, so this
    information is now in all documentations, where useful.
