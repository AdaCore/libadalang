title: Take private visibility into account
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where ``private with`` clauses were previously not
    considered any different than their non-private counterpart. This could
    cause ambiguities in some scenarios, such as in:

    .. code:: ada

        with A.Foo;
        private with B.Foo;

        package A.Test is
            use B;

            X : Foo.T;
        private
            ...
        end A.Test;

    In the above code, the identifier ``Foo`` in the declaration of ``X``
    necessarily references ``A.Foo``, because ``B.Foo`` is not yet "with"ed.
    Previously, Libadalang would sometimes resolve to the incorrect package
    because it would incorrectly consider ``B.Foo`` to be visible.
