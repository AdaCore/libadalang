title: Fix ``p_fully_qualified_name`` on generic decls
description: |
  This change fixes a discrepancy in the behavior of
  ``p_fully_qualified_name`` (and other properties relying on it such as
  ``p_unique_identifying_name``) where applying it to a ``GenericDecl`` node
  in the context of an instantiation would return the fully qualified name of
  the generic declaration itself instead of that of the instantiation, whereas
  calling it on the ``GenericSubpInternal`` or ``GenericPackageInternal`` nodes
  (as returned by ``p_designated_subp`` for example) would return that of the
  instantiation.

  We decided to make both return that of the instantiation. The non-instantiated
  name can be returned by first applying the ``p_get_uninstantiated_node``
  property on the given node.
