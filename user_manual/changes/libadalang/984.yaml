type: bugfix
title: Usage of GPR source directories for preprocessing
description: |
    ``Libadalang.Preprocessing.Extract_Preprocessor_Data_From_Project`` used to
    look for preprocessor data files relative to GPR object directories only.
    However, when the GPRbuild -x option is present, these files should also be
    searched in source directories: this is now fixed.
