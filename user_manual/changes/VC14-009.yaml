title: Nameres taft amendment types in generic contexts
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where a Taft-amendment type could in certain cases
    not be resolved to its completion but to its incomplete view. In turn,
    an expression involving a taft-amendment type (for example ``X.Field``
    where ``X``'s type is a taft-amendment record type with a component
    ``Field``) might not be resolved properly because of the incomplete
    knowledge about that type (in the example, because Libadalang might not
    see the component ``Field``).
