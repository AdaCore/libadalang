title: Fix ``for in`` loop name resolution
description: |
  Name resolution of ``for in`` loop checks that the iterator comes from a valid
  iterable type. The predicate used to do so was only checking for types coming
  from the Ada ``Iterator_Interfaces`` package. This change allows the predicate
  to take into account user-defined iterable types (ones specified by the
  ``Iterable`` aspect).
