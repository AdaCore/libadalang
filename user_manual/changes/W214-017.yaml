title: Fix `p_get_aspect` to take inherited aspect into account
description: |
    This change fixes an issue where `p_get_aspect` could return an invalid
    result by missing inherited aspects. For example, derived or subtype
    declarations should also consider aspects of their corresponding root type
    declaration.
