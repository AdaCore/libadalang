title: Resolve generic formal objects
description: |
    When analyzing generic code from an instantiation, libadalang's name
    resolution mechanism now resolves references to generic formal objects to
    their actual wrapped in a synthetic object declaration, instead of
    resolving to the declaration of the formal. Take for example:

    .. code:: ada

       generic
           X : Integer;
       package Foo_G is
           type T is range 1 .. X;
       end Foo_G;

       package Foo_10 is new Foo_G (X => 10);
       subtype U is Foo_10.T;

    By calling ``P_Designated_Type_Decl`` on node ``Foo_10.T``, you will reach
    ``type T is range 1 .. X``. Previously, calling ``P_Referenced_Decl`` on
    ``X``, would return the declaration ``X : Integer`` from the generic
    formal part.

    Now, it will instead generate a new object decl which contains the
    expression of the actual used for ``X``, which would be ``10`` here,
    thus allowing users to reflect upon the value used in the instantiation.

    Thanks to this, the static expression evaluator can now correctly evaluate
    static expressions inside generic code that refer to static formal
    objects. As such, calling ``P_Eval_As_Int`` on ``X`` taken from above will
    now correctly yield ``10`` instead of an error.
