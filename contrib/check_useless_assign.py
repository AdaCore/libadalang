"""
This checker will detect a useless assignments to local variables of two kinds:
(1) the local variable is reassigned with no possible read since the assignment
(2) the subprogram returns before the variable is read.

In the first case, the reassignment must be at the same scope level, or in a
scope above, the initial assignment. So the following useless assignment will
be detected::

   if Cond then
      X := 0;
   end if;
   X := 1;

but not this one::

   X := 0;
   if Cond then
      X := 1;
   else
      X := 2;
   end if;

In the second case, the return must be at the same scope level, or in a
scope above, the initial assignment. So the following useless assignment will
be detected::

   if Cond then
      X := 0;
   end if;
   return;

but not this one::

   X := 0;
   if Cond then
      return;
   else
      return;
   end if;

Record paths like X.Y are considered as well, so the following useless
assignment will be detected::

   if Cond then
      X.Y := 0;
   end if;
   X := 1;

as well as this one::

   if Cond then
      X.Y := 0;
   end if;
   X.Y := 1;
