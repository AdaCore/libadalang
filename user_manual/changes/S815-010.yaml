title: Improved handling of aggregate projects

description: |
   Until now, project unit providers used to reject all aggregate projects.
   This is impractical as it is not always possible to load directly aggregated
   projects. Hence, the goal of this enhancement is to enable Libadalang users
   to load aggregate projects as long as we can guarantee non-ambiguous
   resolution of dependencies.

   The project unit provider in all APIs now accepts aggregate projects as long
   as there is only one aggregated project.

   Additionally, the project unit provider in the Ada API
   (``Libadalang.Project_Provider``) provides two additional constructors
   (``Create_Project_Unit_Provider`` and
   ``Create_Project_Unit_Provider_Reference``) which take any project tree
   (including all aggregate ones) plus one non-aggregate project in that tree.
   The project provider will then consider only this sub-project to resolve
   dependencies unambiguously.
