    This test checks the formatting of a task type declaration
    with known discriminant and interfaces.
    It is expected the declaration breaks before `is` and `with`
    keywords and be formatted by indenting the interfaces list
    elements and the declarations part; keep the `task`, `is` and
    `end` keywords aligned.
