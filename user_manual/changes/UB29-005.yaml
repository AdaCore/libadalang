title: API to get the list of sources from a project file
description: |
    In the Ada API, the ``Libadalang.Helpers.List_Sources_From_Project``
    function was removed and replaced with
    ``Libadalang.Project_Provider.Source_Files``, with signature changes to
    make it more configurable: it is now possible to get sources from
    externally built projects as well as from the runtime.  This API has also
    been bound to the Python bindings (``libadalang.SourceFiles.for_project``).
