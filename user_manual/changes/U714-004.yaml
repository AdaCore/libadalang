title: Fix rebindings on generic instantiations
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where a generic instantiation node returned by
    a property such as ``P_Referenced_Decl`` could contain invalid rebindings
    in some scenarios, leading further queries on that node (such as
    ``P_Designated_Subp``) to crash with an ``old_env present twice in
    rebindings`` error.
