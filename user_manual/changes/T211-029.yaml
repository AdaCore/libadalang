type: bugfix
title: Fix name resolution of index constraints.
description: |
    Consider the following subtype declaration:

    .. code:: ada

       type Arr_Type is (Character range <>) of Integer;
       subtype Arr_A_E of Arr_Type ('A' .. 'E');

    Previously, the literals ``'A'`` and ``'E'`` would be assigned incorrect
    types because we did not take into account the expected index type
    (here ``Character``) of the constraint array type.
