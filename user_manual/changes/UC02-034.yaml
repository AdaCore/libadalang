title: Fix ``P_Next_Part_For_decl`` on GenericDecl nodes
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where calling ``P_Next_Part_For_decl`` on a
    ``GenericDecl`` node would return None. This would impact all properties
    based on it such as ``P_Body_Part_For_Decl``. It would only return the
    expected result when called on the internal declaration
    (``GenericPackageInternal`` or ``GenericSubpInternal``).
