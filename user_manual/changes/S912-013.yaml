title: Add properties for computing unit dependencies

description: |
    This change adds three new properties that are about computing the set
    of units upon with a given one depends.
    - P_Withed_Units returns the set of units that are "with"ed by the given
      unit.
    - P_Imported_Units returns the set of units that are directly imported by
      the given unit, which the set of "with"ed units along with the parent
      unit in case it's a child unit, etc.
    - P_Unit_Dependencies is like P_Imported_Units but includes transitive
      dependencies, effectively returning the whole closure of units which
      the given one depends upon.
