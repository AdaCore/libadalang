title: Fix pragma associated declarations search
description: |
    Libadalang used to compare names to search for pragma's associated
    declarations which could lead to wrong results when nested packages are
    involved in the comparison.

    .. code-block:: ada

       package Pkg.Child is
          pragma Pure (Child);
       end Pkg.Child;

    Package ``Pkg.Child`` declaration was not associated with ``pragma Pure
    (Child)`` because of names comparison. This is now fixed by comparing
    ``Child``'s referenced declaration with its enclosing unit declaration.
