title: Nameres crash on instantiations of Modular_IO
description: |
    Previously, name resolution would crash when trying to resolve names in
    a package instantiation whose designated generic package was Modular_IO
    from Ada.Text_IO. This was because the special handling of child units
    of Ada.Text_IO was missing a case for the Modular_IO package.
