title: Fix some properties' behavior wrt. synthetic types
description: |
    Some types are synthetized in Libadalang, because they don't exist in the
    original source, such as classwide types, base subtypes for discrete types,
    and some anonymous access types.

    Some properties such as ``BasicDecl.p_parent_basic_decl`` and
    ``BasicDecl.p_fully_qualified_name`` wouldn't work correctly on them.

    Now ``BasicDecl.p_parent_basic_decl`` works as expected, and returns the
    parent basic declaration of the linked type for the synthetic type, and
    ``BasicDecl.p_fully_qualified_name`` returns the name of the linked type
    with a relevant suffix which allows the unique identification of the type
    (``A'Class``, ``A'Base``, etc.)
