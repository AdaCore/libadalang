title: Improve support for delta and digits constraints
description: |
    This change improves the support for delta constraints and digits
    constraints in two ways: calling ``is_static_decl`` on a SubtypeDecl
    having one of these two constraints now works as expected instead of
    always returning ``False``. This also fixed a bug where name resolution
    would fail when processing a SubtypeDecl with a delta constraint or digits
    constraint without a range constraint, as in:

    .. code:: ada

        subtype My_Fixed_Subtype is My_Fixed_Type delta 0.2;

        subtype My_Float_subtype is My_Float_Type digits 4;

    These declarations now resolve correctly.
