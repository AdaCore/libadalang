title: Implement primitives merging in ``Get_Primitives``
description: |
    This change improves the behavior of the property in the following code
    pattern:

    .. code:: ada

        type I1 is interface;
        procedure Foo (X : I1);

        type I2 is interface;
        procedure Foo (X : I2);

        type T is new I1 and I2;

    Previously, ``Get_Primitives`` invoked on type T would return the two
    inherited primitives, from I1 and I2. Now, the primitives are "merged"
    and ``Get_Primitives`` will only return the one that is inherited first
    when multiple primitives are compatible (so, the one from I1 in that case).
