title: Crash on dotted name with ambiguous suffix
description: |
    This changes fixes a bug where name resolution could crash when resolving
    the suffix of a dotted name, if that suffix taken out of context could
    designate both an access type component of a tagged record type,
    or a procedure of that same tagged record type. In particular, this bug
    would trigger when such a dotted name would be used in the context of a
    comparison with the Null literal.
