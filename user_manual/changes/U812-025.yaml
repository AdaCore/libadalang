title: Change behavior of ``TypeDecl.is_record_type``

description: |
    Previous behavior was to return ``True`` on private tagged types extending
    a public tagged type, which did yield unintuitive results when used in
    conjunction with properties expecting record types, such as ``shapes``.

    Now ``is_record_type`` simply returns whether the type has publicly
    directly visible component (eg. directly contains a record definition).
