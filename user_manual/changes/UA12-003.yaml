title: Wrong documentation for the ``Is_Ghost`` property
description: |
    The documentation of the ``Is_Ghost`` property mentionned ``Token_First``
    instead of ``Token_Start`` and ``Token_Last`` instead of ``Token_End``, and
    used to state that for ghost nodes, the former returned no token, whereas
    it is supposed to return the same as ``Token_Start``. Both issues are fixed
    in the documentation.
