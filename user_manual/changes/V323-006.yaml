title: Add ``P_Is_Subaggregate`` property
description: |
    This new property can be invoked on aggregate nodes and returns whether
    the aggregate actually corresponds to a multidimensional array subaggregate
    as per RM 4.3.3. Since subaggregates are special (they have no expected
    type nor actual type), this property can be used to detect them so as to
    treat them in a specific way.
