title: Assignments with ``Implicit_Dereference`` aspect
description: |
    This change fixes a bug where name resolution would fail when resolving
    an assignment of the form ``X := (E => ...);`` where ``X`` is implicitly
    deferenced and the right-hand side is an aggregate expression matching
    the dereferenced type.
