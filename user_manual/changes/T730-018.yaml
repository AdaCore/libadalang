type: bugfix
title: Handle library-level ``use all type`` clauses
description: |
    Previously, such clauses appearing at the library-level of a unit would
    be totally ignored, which could cause name resolution failures on nodes
    using this construct to gain visibility on a type's operations,
    including the case where the clause is used to make direct references
    to the literals of an enum type. This is now fixed.
