title: Renaming of values for the ``RefResultKind`` enum type
description: |
    In all APIs, the values of the ``RefResultKind`` enumeration type have been
    renamed. For instance, in the Ada API, ``Noref`` was renamed to ``No_Ref``,
    while in the Python API, it has been renamed to ``no_ref``, for consistency
    with casing conventions in similar identifiers.
