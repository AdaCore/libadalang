title: CW types and ``P_Base_Subp_Declarations``
description: |
    The ``P_Base_Subp_Declarations`` property could return incorrect results
    when called on a subprogram which signature involved the classwide type
    of the tagged type of which the subprogram is a primitive. In such cases,
    ``P_Base_Subp_Declarations`` would always return the singleton list only
    containing the subprogram on which the property was called.
