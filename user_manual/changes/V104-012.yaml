title: Defaults for generic formal types (Ada 2022)
description: |
    This change implements the Ada 2022 feature that allows default subtypes to
    be specified in generic formal type parameters.

    This change breaks the API because of some parsing incompatibilities
    introduced by the feature. Indeed, this feature allows to set a default type
    for a generic formal type parameter thanks to the ``or use`` keywords. Basic
    type declarations now differ from the formal type declarations used to
    declare type parameters within a generic instantiation by the position of
    their ``aspects`` field. To workaround this incompatibilty, we made
    ``TypeDecl`` abstract and introduced some new nodes:

      * ``ConcreteTypeDecl``, which is used in place of ``TypeDecl``, and
        represents concrete type declarations.
      * ``FormalTypeDecl`` represents the type declaration used as generic
        formal parameters.
      * ``FormalIncompleteTypeDecl`` represents the incomplete type declaration
        used as generic formal parameters.
