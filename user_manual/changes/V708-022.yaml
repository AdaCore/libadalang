title: "Preprocessing data extraction from GPR projects"
description: |
  Functions were introduced to create file readers that can preprocess source
  files based on preprocessor configuration found in GPR projects. In Ada, see
  the ``Extract_Preprocessor_Data_From_Project`` functions in the
  ``Libadalang.Preprocessing`` package; in Python, see the
  ``GPRProject.create_preprocessor`` method.
