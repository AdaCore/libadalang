title: Enhance support for aggregate projects
description: |
    Unit providers based on projects have been enhanced to better support
    aggregate projects.

    First, the Ada API makes it possible to create multiple unit providers from
    a single aggregate project so that each unit providers has access to a
    consistent set of analysis units: see
    ``Libadalang.Project_Provider.Create_Project_Unit_Providers``. This is
    useful when you want to analyze an aggregate project that contains
    alternative implementations of the same unit.

    Second, the Ada API no longer provides a direct access to the
    ``Project_Unit_Provider`` type. Since
    ``Libadalang.Analysis.Create_Context`` takes a reference type
    (``Unit_Provider_Reference``), exposing the interface derivation is not
    necessary and just brings confusion.

    Third, the C, Python and OCaml APIs now provide the ability to create a
    project unit provider with a view narrowed to a sub-project (see the
    ``project`` project unit provider constructor argument). If no sub-project
    is specified, then the constructor fallbacks to the project partition
    strategy described above: when the loaded project tree contains
    inconsistent units (i.e. multiple unit providers would be required), an
    error is raised.
