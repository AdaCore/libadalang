title: Enhance expr evaluator with relation operators
description: |
    This change enhances Libadalang's expression evaluator such that it can
    now evaluate expression containing relation operators
    (``=, /=, <, <=, >, >=``) on all supported types. Note that only ``=``
    and ``/=`` are supported on enum and string values.
