    a dotted name exceeding the maximal line length to designate
    the package.

    on the same line and break before .; the other fields are aligned
    taking as initial indent the first field starting position and
    adding a line continuation indentation (i.e., 2 spaces) before each .
    for the other fields on the next lines.
