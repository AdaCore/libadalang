    This test checks the formatting of a simple constrained array
    type declaration having the maximum line exceeded due to the
    constraint list specification.
    It is expected the declaration be splitted in multiple lines and
    breaks after the is and of keywords and these new lines will be
    indented with a line contination indentation (i.e., 2 spaces); the
    constraint list will break before the double dot and the new line
    will be aligned on the constraint low limit initial position.
