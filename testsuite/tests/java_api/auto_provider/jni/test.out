Using null charset:
<ObjectDecl ["X"] c.ads:5:4-5:12> has type <ConcreteTypeDecl ["T"] a.ads:2:4-2:26>
<ObjectDecl ["Y"] c.ads:6:4-6:12> has type None
Using utf-8 charset:
<ObjectDecl ["X"] c.ads:5:4-5:12> has type <ConcreteTypeDecl ["T"] a.ads:2:4-2:26>
<ObjectDecl ["Y"] c.ads:6:4-6:12> has type None
