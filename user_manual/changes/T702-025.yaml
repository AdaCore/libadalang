title: Remove ``Debug_Text`` APIs

description: |
    The name of this function was misleading: it had the ``Debug`` prefix not
    because it was "safe for debug" to call it (just like ``Text``, it would
    crash on a null node), but because it turned the node text into ASCII using
    escaping for non-ASCII parts of the source, which can be useful for debug
    or logging. Users should prefer the ``Image`` function for debug, which
    should be familiar to Ada users.

    Current uses of ``Debug_Text`` can just call ``Text`` and transform its
    ``Text_Type`` result into a ``String`` using
    ``Langkit_Support.Text.Image``, which is exactly what ``Debug_Text`` did.
    Or they can of course switch to ``Image``, which is much better for
    debug/logging.
