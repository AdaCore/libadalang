type: bugfix
title: Various pragma support improvements
description: |
  This change improves the aspect/pragma support by correctly
  handling pragmas associated to components and to enum literals.

  Consequently, Libadalang now correctly supports the ``Independent`` and
  ``Obsolescent`` (implementation-defined) pragmas.
