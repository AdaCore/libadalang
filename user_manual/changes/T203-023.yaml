    universal type
short_title: Fix bug in name resolution of binops
description: |
    Libadalang would often wrongly assume that both operands of a binary
    operation have the same type, overlooking the case where one of the
    operands has an universal type, in which case it can get implicitly
    converted to the type of the other operand.
